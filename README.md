An generative experiment to celebrate the Global Beatles Day, june 25th.

This project is about creative coding and a tribute to the greatest band of all time.

The idea is to create a visual representation of The Beatlesâ€™ song Here Comes The Sun dynamically generated by an algorithm developed with Processing and Processing.js.

UPDATE! Now the experiment direct through browser via JavaScript code thanks to p5.js library.
